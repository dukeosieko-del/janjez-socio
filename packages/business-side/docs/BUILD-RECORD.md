## 3. Deployment State

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Vercel project | `ez-business-side` |
| Canonical domain | `business.janjez.social` |
| Status | Live |
| Vercel CLI | 59.23.2 |
| Supabase CLI | 2.117.0 |
| Vercel login | Pending owner authorization |

### Live Deployment Health (2026-09-18T19:24Z)

| Endpoint | Result |
|----------|--------|
| `https://business.janjez.social/` | 200 ✅ |
| `https://business.janjez.social/auth/sign-in` | 200 ✅ |
| `https://business.janjez.social/dashboard` | 200 ✅ |
| `https://business.janjez.social/api/health` | `{"status":"ok","dependencies":{"database":"healthy","dbLatencyMs":513}}` ✅ |
| `https://business.janjez.social/pay` | 404 (not in app code) |
| `https://business.janjez.social/orders/all` | 404 (not in app code) |

### Jest Hero Regression Tests
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Renders all required copy | ✅ PASS |
| Primary CTA routes to /auth/sign-in | ✅ PASS |
| Category cards route correctly, no duplicates | ✅ PASS |
| Page body not buried under fixed overlay | ✅ PASS |

**Note:** `npm run test:hero` script references `tests/hero-bottom-panel.spec.ts` but file is `.js` — run via `npx jest tests/hero-bottom-panel.spec.js` instead.

### /pay and /orders/all 404 Diagnosis
- Neither route exists in app code (`app/` directory), next.config, or any proxy/rewrite config
- No nginx or external proxy configuration found
- These may be intended as Janjez main routes (external to island app) or need implementation

### Brand Line Analysis (main's landing page)
"Janjez Business Side" appears in 4 locations:
1. **Hero pill badge** (line 88) — green pulse indicator
2. **Hero headline** (line 94) — "Build Your Social Media Business on Kenya&apos;s #1 SMM Infrastructure"
3. **Footer brand block** (lines 295-297) — "Janjez Business Side" + "Kenya&apos;s infrastructure for social media entrepreneurs."
4. **Footer copyright** (line 359)

The string "Kenya's infrastructure for social media entrepreneurs." originally intended for hero bottom panel now appears only in footer brand block — no longer in hero position.

### 502 Error Diagnosis (from prior investigation)
- `/pay` and `/orders/all` are NOT routes on the island Next.js app
- These routes are expected to be proxied to Janjez main API
- RSC prefetches to these paths fail because they don't exist
- **Resolution:** These routes need to be either implemented on island or removed from the UI to prevent failed prefetches

## 4. Visual Verification (Historical)

Previous verification was done on session branch `kilo/emerald-dolphin-b37` with `app/page.tsx` (226 lines, bottom panel overlay approach). This has been **superseded** by main's rebuilt landing page (373 lines, hero section + 5 sections + footer).

### Previous Verification Results (bottom panel approach)
- **Desktop (1440×900):** `isOnTop: true`, `position: absolute`, `zIndex: 20`, `inViewport: true` ✅
- **Mobile (390×844):** `isOnTop: true`, `position: absolute`, `zIndex: 20`, `inViewport: true` ✅
- **Scroll test:** `inViewport: false` after scroll ✅
- Screenshots: `screenshots/desktop-1440x900.png`, `screenshots/mobile-390x844.png` (now deleted in cleanup commit)

### Current State (main's landing page)
- `app/page.tsx`: 373 lines with `min-h-screen`, 5 sections, footer
- No bottom panel overlay — hero is a top-level section
- Brand line `Janjez Business Side` + `Kenya's infrastructure for social media entrepreneurs.` remains in footer (line 295) and footer copyright (line 359) — **discrepancy noted but not yet resolved**
- Hero section has: pill badge "Janjez Business Side", headline "Build Your Social Media Business on Kenya&apos;s #1 SMM Infrastructure"

## 5. Key Configuration

### babel.config.js
```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['babel-preset-current-node-syntax'],
  plugins: [
    '@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx',
    ['@babel/plugin-syntax-typescript', { isTSX: true }],
  ],
};
```
Fix for build blocker: `isTSX: true` enables TSX parsing.

### Environment Variables (`.env.example`)
42 variables defined, all empty placeholders. Key missing values:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `JANJEZ_MAIN_API_KEY`, `JANJEZ_MAIN_API_SECRET`
- `MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY`, `MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `MPESA_PASSKEY`, `MPESA_SHORTCODE`
- `HMAC_SECRET` (≥32 chars required by Zod validation)
- No `.env` on main (`.env.example` only)

### Dependency Notes
- `jose` NOT found in `package.json` on main or session branch
- Next.js 16.3.5, React 19.2.8, Tailwind v4, TypeScript 5

## 7. Root Cause — 404 Auth Issue

The `/api/auth/check` endpoint returns 404 because the island Next.js app does not implement an auth verification API route. The `app/` directory contains static auth pages (`/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/error`, `/auth/callback`) but no `/api/auth/*` route handlers. Authentication state validation on the island side relies on Supabase session checks in client components rather than a dedicated API endpoint. The auth bridge (197 lines across 6 files) addresses this by providing server-side auth validation logic.
